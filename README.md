jcURL
=====

Java Client URL Request Library - Java implementation of a cURL (Client URL Request Library) like tool.

Synopsis
========

    java -jar jcurl.jar [options] [URL...]

Description
===========

jcurl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols (only HTTP supported at the moment). 
The command is designed to work without user interaction.

URL
===

The URL syntax is protocol dependent. Youâ€™ll find a detailed description in RFC 2396.

You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets within braces as in:

http://site.{one,two,three}.com

or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

http://www.numericals.com/page-[1-100].html 
http://www.numericals.com/page-[001-100].html (with leading zeros) 
http://www.letters.com/page-[a-z].html

No nesting of the sequences is supported at the moment, but you can use several ones next to each other:

http://any.org/archive-[1996-1999]/vol-[1-4]/part-{a,b,c}.html

You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line.

Each URL is encoding with default system charset. To encode in specific chareset, launch jcurl with JVM parameter `-Dfile.encoding` for example:

```bash
   java -Dfile.encoding=ISO-8859-1 -jar jcurl.jar [options] [URL...]
```

## SSL Communication 
After compiling, you will get the `jcurl-1-SNAPSHOT-BUNDLE.jar`, use: 

```bash
java -Djavax.net.debug=ssl  \ 
     -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/home/xxx/cacerts  \  # here is jks type of CA
     -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=ChangeThePwd  \ 
     -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/home/xxx/tls.jks  \    # here is jks type of client cert 
     -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=ChangeThePwd \ 
     -jar jcurl-1-SNAPSHOT-BUNDLE.jar  https://xxxx.domain.com/xxxx/service
```
